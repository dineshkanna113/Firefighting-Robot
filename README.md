## 🔧 Hardware Required

- ESP32 board  
- 2 DC Motors + L298N driver  
- 3 Flame sensors  
- Water pump module  
- Servo motor (SG90/standard)  
- Power supply (battery)

## 🧠 Logic Overview

- If no input is received from the GamePad, flame sensors guide the robot toward fire.
- Water pump activates when any flame is detected.
- Servo rotates automatically toward the flame direction.
- Manual override using Circle/Square for fine servo positioning.
